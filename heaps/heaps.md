## Heaps Data Structure

Heaps are a data structure that can be expressed as a complete tree, where all levels in the tree are full except for the lowest level, which may have some empty nodes. Heaps can be visualized as a tree, but they are actually implemented as an array. In a max heap, the largest key is stored at the root, and every parent node has a higher key than its children. In a min heap, the root contains the smallest key, and every parent node has a smaller key than its children.

The process of inserting a key into a heap involves adding the key at the bottom-right position of the tree and then rearranging the nodes to maintain the heap property. This process is called heapify. Similarly, extracting the highest key from a heap involves removing the root node and rearranging the remaining nodes to maintain the heap property.

Heaps are commonly used to implement priority queues, where elements are extracted based on their priority. The time complexity of inserting and extracting from a heap is O(log n), where n is the size of the array representing the heap. The heapify process, which maintains the heap property, is the most crucial part and determines the time complexity.

In the example, we demonstrate how to implement a max heap in Go. We define a struct for the max heap, with an array to store the keys. then implement an insert method to add keys to the heap and a max heapify method to rearrange the nodes after insertion or extraction.

The insert method appends the new key to the array and then performs the heapify process to maintain the heap property by comparing the new key with its parent and swapping if necessary.

The max heapify method is used to rearrange the nodes after extracting the root. It compares the root with its child nodes, swaps if necessary, and repeats the process until the index has no children or finds its right place in the heap.

The time complexity of inserting and extracting from the heap is O(log n), where n is the size of the array representing the heap.

It concludes by demonstrating the insertion and extraction processes using the implemented max heap. It is shown how the largest key is always at the front of the heap, and the swapping process can be observed during extraction.

Overall, heaps are powerful data structures that can efficiently handle operations like insertion, extraction, and maintaining priority.
